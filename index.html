<h1 id="the-markdown-resume">The Markdown Resume</h1>
<p>Christophe-Marie Duquesne has a great <a href="http://blog.chmd.fr/editing-a-cv-in-markdown-with-pandoc.html">blog post</a> wherein he shows that using <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>, you can maintain your resume in markdown format and convert to other formats such as html and Word at will. However, the recommendation for obtaining a pdf is to use the <a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/">wkhtmltopdf tool</a>, which takes the pandoc-generated HTML and uses the webkit browser engine to generate a pdf.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, webkit is not a typesetting engine, so the pdf output is suboptimal; most importantly, it does not handle page breaks well, in some cases even putting a page break right across a line of text.</p>
<p>TeX-based typesetting systems are designed for this task however, and fortunately pandoc supports two types of TeX output: LaTeX and <a href="http://wiki.contextgarden.net/">ConTeXt</a>. I chose the latter since it seemed interesting, is more focused on page layout, and is not specialized for scientific documents. Using a style.tex which emulates Christophe-Marie's style.css, we can create a nicely typeset pdf document which looks quite similar to the HTML:</p>
<p>HTML version of the resume:</p>
<iframe src="resume.html" width=100% height=500px></iframe>

<p>PDF version of the resume:</p>
<object data="resume.pdf" type="application/pdf" width=100% height=500px></object>

<p>The repository is <a href="https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume">here</a> (pull requests welcome), so you can clone it, insert your own resume.md, and have your own sweet pdf resume in no time!</p>
